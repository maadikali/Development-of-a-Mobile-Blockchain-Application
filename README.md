The diploma project called "Development of a mobile blockchain application", made by Kaliyev Madiyar and Kozhakhmetov Narbek, presents the development of a crowdfunding mobile application leveraging blockchain technology to enhance security, transparency, and efficiency in fundraising. The application was designed and implemented using React Native and Expo for the frontend, and Solidity smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain for the backend. WalletConnect and Wagmi were integrated to facilitate secure wallet connections and blockchain interactions, eliminating the need for traditional email and password authentication. The diploma work consists of 78 pages, 27 references and 19 figures.

The theoretical section of this project explores the foundational concepts of blockchain technology and its application in the crowdfunding industry. It highlights the critical issues of fraud, lack of transparency, and inefficiencies in traditional crowdfunding platforms and demonstrates how blockchain technology can address these challenges through its immutable and verifiable ledger. In the practical section, the report details the comprehensive development process, including the creation of key application features such as project creation, fund contribution, and user profile management. Robust security measures, including input validation, access control, and encryption, were implemented to protect user data and transactions. Extensive testing, including unit tests, integration tests, static analysis, and manual code reviews, was conducted to ensure the functionality and security of both the frontend and smart contracts. 

The results and achievements of the project are demonstrated through the successful implementation of the applicationâ€™s core functionalities, positive initial user feedback, and encouraging usage metrics. The project has shown that blockchain technology can significantly improve the crowdfunding process, providing a secure, transparent, and user-friendly platform for both project creators and contributors. 

This report concludes with an evaluation of the project's effectiveness, potential paths for implementation, and recommendations for future improvements. The successful development of this application underscores the transformative potential of blockchain technology in modern financial systems, providing a robust foundation for future advancements in the field.
